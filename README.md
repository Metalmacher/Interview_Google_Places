# Interview_Google_Places

Old quicky made during interview, in Angular 2.3. 
App will search for locations based on the text that is written, via Google Places, and will display a list of near ( <= 50000 meters) restaurants near you. Restaurants are mock-ish, written inside restaurants.js. Currently they're situated around the location "כפר מונש" so to test just type that and hit submit.

Google API key is required, needs to be specified inside index.html
