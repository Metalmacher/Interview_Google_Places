# Interview_Google_Places

Old quicky made during interview, in Angular 2.3. 
App will search for locations based on the text that is written, via Google Places, and will display a list of restaurants near you ( <= 50000 meters). 
Restaurants are mock-ish, written inside restaurants.ts. Currently they're situated around the location "כפר מונש" so to test just type that and hit submit.

Google API key is required, needs to be specified inside index.html

Naturally all dependencies are deprecated by now, but it works, so don't bother to audit. 

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
